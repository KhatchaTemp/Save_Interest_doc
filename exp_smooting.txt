Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method that is commonly used to predict future values 
based on the weighted average of past observations. It is generally applied to univariate time series data, 
where the goal is to predict the next value in the series.

import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing

# Example sales data
data = {'Month': ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'],
        'Sales': [100, 120, 110, 130, 105]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Fit exponential smoothing model
model = ExponentialSmoothing(df['Sales'], trend='add', seasonal=None)
result = model.fit()

# Make predictions for the next period
forecast = result.forecast(steps=1)

print("Forecast for the next period:", forecast.values[0])
